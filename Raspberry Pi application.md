# Biometric-attendence-system
**OBJECTIVE**
To develop a smart office automation system using AS608 fingerprint sensor to record attendance and optimize power usage in the offices.

**ABSTRACT**
This project proposes the development of a smart fingerprint-based embedded system that can effectively manage attendance and power usage in office environments. The system utilizes the AS608 fingerprint sensor, which is capable of storing up to 127 unique fingerprints with corresponding IDs.

By interfacing the fingerprint sensor with a Raspberry Pi board, the system can record and store the fingerprints alongside their unique IDs. When an employee scans their fingerprint to enter their office, the sensor identifies their identity and marks their attendance, and subsequently turns on the lights and fans in their office area. When the employee scans their fingerprint to leave their office the lights and fans are automatically turned off.

This innovative system offers a sustainable solution to optimize power consumption in offices to benefit the environment and ensures that power is used only when necessary, helping to reduce overall energy consumption and costs. Additionally, using a fingerprint sensor ensures accurate attendance recording which eliminates the need for traditional manual attendance registers that are often time-consuming to maintain and are prone to human errors. 

Overall, this system is an effective solution for managing attendance and optimizing power usage in the office environment, reducing administrative workload, and promoting sustainable energy consumption.
